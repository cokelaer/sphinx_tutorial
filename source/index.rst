.. topic:: What is Sphinx and the RST syntax ?


    `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_ is a tool that ease the creation of
    documentation for software written in **Python**. Nevertheless, it can be 
    used for other languages and more general documentation such as this document. 
    Sphinx is widely used within the Python community and there are already many 
    good tutorials and documentation about it. This tutorial was started
    a while ago when Sphinx project started. I've been using sphinx professionally 
    and for my own purpose. Since I've taken quite a few notes, 
    I put them together and put it online, hoping it could be of interest for some of you.

In the `Starting with Sphinx`_ section, the sub-sections :ref:`introduction` and :ref:`quickstart` provide will guide you on starting your own Sphinx project. If you want to see the RST and Sphinx syntax, jump directly to the :ref:`rst_tutorial` section.

Finally, if you are using Sphinx to document a Python project, have a look at the sections :ref:`docstring_python` and :ref:`doctest`.

This tutorial is not covering all Sphinx possibilities and I would strongly recommend anyone willing to use sphinx to look at the sphinx homepage for latests updates and especially the multitude of add-ons (**directives**) that are added all the time (e.g. LaTeX can be included, plots, ...).
