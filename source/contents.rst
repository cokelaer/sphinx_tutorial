.. topic:: What is Sphinx and the RST syntax ?


    `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_ is a tool that ease the creation of
    documentation for computer languages such as **Python**. Besides, in can be use to 
    write more general documentation such as this document. Sphinx is widely 
    used within the Python community and there are already many good tutorials 
    and documentation about it. Nevertheless, I've been using it a lot 
    professionally and for my own purpose. Since I've taken quite a few notes, 
    I put them together and put it online, hoping it could be of interest for some of you.

In the `Starting with Sphinx`_, :ref:`introduction` and :ref:`quickstart` provides the tools to start your own Sphinx project. If you want to see the RST and Sphinx syntax, jump directly to the :ref:`rst_tutorial` section.

Finally, if you are using Sphinx to document a Python project, have a look at the sections :ref:`docstring_python` and :ref:`doctest`.
