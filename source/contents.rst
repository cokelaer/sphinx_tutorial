.. topic:: What is Sphinx and the RST syntax ?

    Sphinx is a tools used to write software documentation but not only. For instance this guide is written with Sphinx. Sphinx is widely used within the Python community and there are already many good tutorials and documentation about it. Nevertheless, I've been using it a lot professionally and for my own purpose. Since I've taken quite a few notes, I put them together and put it online, hoping it could be of interest for some of you.

In the `Sphinx Overview`_, :ref:`introduction` and :ref:`quickstart` provides the tools to start your own Sphinx project. If you want to see the RST and Sphinx syntax, jump directly to the :ref:`rst_tutorial` section.

Finally, if you are using Sphinx to document a Python project, have a look at the sections :ref:`docstring_python` and :ref:`doctest`.
