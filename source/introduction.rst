Introduction
============

`Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_ is a tool that ease the creation of
documentation for computer languages such as **Python** but also C/C++. All the following
pages are written and generated thanks to **Sphinx**.


Nevertheless, Sphinx requires to learn a new syntax, called **ReST** or **RST**. To get an idea of the syntax, click on the **show Source** link in the right side bar, in any page.

The advantage of the ReST syntax resides in its human-readable nature, which makes it useful to include in docstrings like in Python. 

ReST and Sphinx provides a rich syntax made of **directives** and Sphinx comes with many plugins/extensions. For instance, you can include LaTeX code for your equations. Yet, there are many directives and extensions, and it is sometimes difficult to figure out their names and options.

These pages give you the elements to start a documentation using Sphinx and provide a summary of directive/options gathered in the RST tutorial section.

.. note:: I should mention that the Sphinx official page is very well done and improves all the time. I encourage you to go and visit their website.
